# Directions:
# -------------------
# Python Robot
# 
# Create a Python main function
# Create a constant- board_size, and intitialize it with a tuple (5, 5)
# Create a constant- board_icon, and intialize it to a character/string of your choice. Ex: ‚Äò - ‚Äô 
# Create a constant- robot_icon, and ini∆üalize it to a character/string of your choice. Ex: ‚Äò :[]: ‚Äô
# Create a constant, robot_start_location, and ini∆üalize it to a tuple containing a valid index
# in regards to the board_size. Ex: (0,0) 
# Create a local variable within main(), current_robot_location, and ini∆üalize it to robot_start_location
# Create a 2D array named board, define a func∆üon, init_board(), that ini∆üalizes the 2D array to
# size board_size, and assigns each index to board_icon. Additionally, this function will put
# the robot_icon on the board at robot_start_location. 
# Define a show_board() func∆üon to print out the 2D array as an n x n board.
# Define a show_menu() function to print a menu: 
# 1- Left
# 2- Backwards
# 3- Forwards
# 4- Right
# 5- Exit
#
# Write a while loop that contains the necessary code to show the menu and get user input.
# Write the logic to take user input and move the robot icon one step on the board in relation to what the user 
# chooses in the menu.
# Error check user input: You can use int(input(‚ÄúExample Prompt‚Äù)) inside a try-catch statement
# to check for correct type, and an if-statement to check for menu bounds.
# Use a switch statement or if-else to handle menu logic.
# Use a generalized functioon for robot movement. You should not need to write a func∆üon for
# each movement direction.
# Error check robot movement requests, so as to not move outside the 2D array.
# Note: Make sure to update current_robot_loca∆üon each ∆üme the robot is moved
